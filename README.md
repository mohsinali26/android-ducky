Rubber Ducky with Android

# Project status

Well, it worked well in 2015 but I hadn't had any use for it recently, so this has gone untested afterwards. I keep it for future reference, but be careful before using. Do your research, adapt and conquer ;-)

...OR, get me some nice PRs and I will merge them.

# What is this repository for ?
* Android version of the famous Rubber Ducky
* Supports non-US keyboard layouts

# How do I get setup ?
* Root you android device
* Check this link for device specific procedure : https://github.com/pelya/android-keyboard-gadget
* Basically you will have to flash a new kernel to add HID keyboard support. Be sure to have TWRP or CWM Recovery otherwise the flashing process might not even start. If you don't have TWRP or CWM Recovery, you can simply download the app Rashr. This requires root though.
* You will need a terminal emulator, I recommend that you install Terminal IDE from the Play Store with Hacker's Keyboard (otherwise the app will crash for Android > 4.4). But you can also use JuiceSSH or whatever.
* You will need cool payloads : https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payloads
* chmod +x hid-gadget-test
* chmod +x droidducky.sh
* Recompile hid.gadget-test.c if you modified it using : ndk-build  NDK_PROJECT_PATH=$(pwd) APP_BUILD_SCRIPT=$(pwd)/Android.mk      

# Usage
* bash droidducky.sh payload.txt ch-fr
* The last parameter is optional. Default is US layout, but you can choose other layouts if you add "fr" or "ch-fr" as parameter.

# Contributions guidelines 
* Add support for your country keyboard layout by editing the "convert" function in droidducky.sh
* If a specific key is not available at the moment, you can submit the issue by telling me what the name of key is with its scancode
* Scancodes for HID keyboard can be found here : http://www.hiemalis.org/~keiji/PC/scancode-translate.pdf
